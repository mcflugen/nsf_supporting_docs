*NSF-EAR 0621695 GEO*: $4.8M (04/01/07 - 03/31/12)  
*Title*: Organizational Infrastructure for the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System  
*PI*: J.P.M. Syvitski; Senior Personnel: E. Hutton (and others).

*Intellectual Merit*: CSDMS catalyzes new paradigms and practices in
developing and employing software to understand the earth’s surface - the
ever-changing dynamic interface between lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere
and atmosphere. CSDMS focuses on the movement of fluids and the sediment and
solutes they transport through landscapes, seascapes and sedimentary basins.

*Broader Impact*: CSDMS supports the development, integration, dissemination
and archiving of community open-source software, that reflects and predicts
earth-surface processes over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales.
Phase 1 ended with a global membership of 700 scientists from 330 institutions
from 49 countries form part of the present CSDMS effort.  CSDMS has organized,
hosted or sponsored 120 workshops, symposia and meetings, providing 11 short
courses and 25 clinics. The CSDMS Model Repository hosts 143 open-source
models, and 49 modeling tools.

*NSF-EAR 1226297 GEO/BIO/ACI*: $4.5M (10/01/12 - 9/31/17)  
*Title*: Computational Infrastructure for the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System  
*PI*: J.P.M. Syvitski; Senior Personnel: E. Hutton (and others).

*Intellectual Merit*: This is an NSF-supported, international and
community-driven program that seeks to transform the science and practice of
earth-surface dynamics modeling. Integration Facility staff have published 78
peer-reviewed papers and provided 105 presentations.

*Broader Impact*: CSDMS2.0 has organized, hosted or sponsored 118 workshops,
symposia and meetings, and offered 22 short courses and 36 clinics. The CSDMS
Model Repository hosts 196 open-source models, and 60 modeling tools.  CSDMS
diverse community of 1370 members represents 176 U.S. institutions (129
academic, 26 private, 21 federal) and 315 non-U.S. institutions (210 acad.,
31 private, 74 govt.) from 68 countries.
