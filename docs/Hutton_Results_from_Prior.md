# Results from Prior NSF Support: Hutton

*NSF-EAR 1226297 GEO/BIO/ACI*: $4.5M (10/01/12 - 9/31/17)  
*Title*: Computational Infrastructure for the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System  
*PI*: J.P.M. Syvitski; Senior Personnel: E. Hutton (and others).

*Intellectual Merit*: This is an NSF-supported, international and
community-driven program that seeks to transform the science and practice of
earth-surface dynamics modeling. One of the main focuses of the project is
to aid in model development and model coupling. Integration Facility staff
have published 48 peer-reviewed papers and provided 85 presentations.

*Broader Impact*: CSDMS2.0 has organized, hosted or sponsored 118 workshops,
symposia and meetings, and offered 22 short courses and 36 clinics. The CSDMS
Model Repository hosts 196 open-source models, and 60 modeling tools.  CSDMS
diverse community of 1370 members represents 176 U.S. institutions (129
academic, 26 private, 21 federal) and 315 non-U.S. institutions (210 acad.,
31 private, 74 govt.) from 68 countries.
