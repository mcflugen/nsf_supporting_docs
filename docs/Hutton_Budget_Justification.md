# Budget Justification

## Software Engineer

*.5 month/y in year 1*

Requirements include experience with system software and surface dynamic
modeling (delta and near-shore processes, in particular), model coupling,
abilities in high level (e.g. IDL, Matlab) and operational level (e.g. C,
C++, Fortran, Python) languages, grid and mesh generation, and numerical
methods (e.g. Eulerian, Lagrangian, implicit/explicit solvers, finite
difference, and finite element methods).

Eric Hutton is the Senior Software Engineer on the NSF-funded CSDMS
(Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System) project. He has proven
experience in multi-language codes, sediment transport and geophysical model
development, and model coupling. Duties will include overseeing and
coordinating the software development necessary to ingest and use
the identified data into the landlab framework.

The PI is a non-tenure track faculty and is funded on soft money.
Due to nature of the work assigned to the PI, we are requesting
salary commensurate with the level of effort required, and in
excess of NSF’s normal allowance of two months per investigator
designated as senior personnel across all funded NSF projects.


## Logistics Coordination

*.5 month/y in year 1*

Lynn McCready is the logistics coordinator and executive assistant
at the NSF-funded CSDMS (Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System).
As part of her work at CSDMS, she has extensive experience
organizing workshops and large international meetings. Duties will
include organizing the planning workshop.


## Accounting Technician and System Administration

*System Administration: .0015 months/y in year 1*  
*Accounting Specialist: .0052 months/y in year 1*  

Partial salary is requested for technical assistance to support the executing,
administration and accounting of Center activities. INSTAAR is a unique unit
of the University of Colorado.  It is solely dedicated to research and
completely separated, though complimentary, to the traditional academic
departments.  INSTAAR is an interdisciplinary Earth and Environmental Systems
Institute, and houses large and complex research programs.  Each individual
investigator has access to a depth and broad range of scientific expertise
that complements his/her research. The system Administrator is responsible for
the IT needs of the project.

## Fringe Benefits

Fringe benefits are calculated on requested salary per the University’s
federally negotiated Rate Agreement with the Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS). The rate used for the PI is 30.3%;
the rate used for research personnel is 37.6%; the rate used for
graduate research assistants is 13.6%, and the rate used for hourly
employees is 1.0%.


## Facilities and Administration (F&A) Costs

Facilities and administration (F&A) costs are charged according
to the University’s federally negotiated rate agreement. The
F&A cost rate for on-campus research is 53% of Modified Total
Direct Cost (MTDC), predetermined for the period 7/1/14 - 6/30/15,
53.5% of MTDC, predetermined for the period 7/1/15 - 6/30/16;
54% MTDC, predetermined for the period 7/1/16 - 6/30/18;
provisional thereafter per HHS agreement dated 07/27/2017.


## Inflation

The University of Colorado’s current budget planning parameters
include an annual inflation factor of 3% for salaries of investigators,
post-doctoral researchers, graduate research assistant, and hourly
students. Tuition is estimated to increase 3% per year, fringe
benefits are estimated to increase 4% per year, and other direct
costs such as travel, can be inflated at 2.3% per year (inflation
of other direct costs is optional).
