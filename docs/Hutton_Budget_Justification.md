# Budget Justification

## Salary Support

Support is requested for Co-PI Tucker at 0.25 months/year to direct the
activities of the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS).
Tucker is currently the Deputy Director of CSDMS, and will become
Executive Director in October 2017.

Support is requested for a postdoctoral associate, Dr. Kimberly Rogers, for 3
month(s) per year for each year of the project. The rate is calculated
at the institutional base salary with an anticipated 3% annual increase
throughout the project. Dr. Rogers will be responsible for identifying
salient components of the human and physical systems necessary for model
input and will communicate these with programmers and model developers
to ensure these are appropriately represented in model code; she will
also be responsible for evaluating and validating integrated model outputs.

Support is also requested for a software engineer, Dr. Eric Hutton, at 1.95
months in year 1 and 1.90 months for years 2, 3 and 4. Requirements
include experience with system software and surface dynamic modeling
(delta and near-shore processes, in particular), model coupling,
abilities in high level (e.g. IDL, Matlab) and operational level
(e.g. C, C++, Fortran, Python) languages, grid and mesh generation,
and numerical methods (e.g. Eulerian, Lagrangian, implicit/explicit
solvers, finite difference, and finite element methods).

Dr. Hutton is the Senior Software Engineer on the NSF-funded CSDMS (Community
Surface Dynamics Modeling System) project. He has proven experience
in multi-language codes, sediment transport and geophysical model
development, and model coupling. Duties will include overseeing
and coordinating the model development necessary to componentize
the identified models so that they conform to the CSDMS model-coupling
protocols.

Dr. Rogers and Dr. Hutton does not have academic appointments and so
receives all of their funding through grants. As a result, they request
two or more months of funding per year from NSF.


## Travel

Travel to Tempe (round-trip airfare of $250; ground transportation of
$100) in years 2 (for Rogers and Hutton), and 3 (for Hutton) to attend
an annual team meeting. Meetings will be three days with a day of
travel to and from Denver and Tempe ($59 per diem for 5 days; 5 nights
of lodging for $169 per night). Travel costs are budgeted to increase
at a rate of 1.8% per year.

## Accounting Technician and System Administration

Partial salary is requested for technical assistance to support the executing,
administration and accounting of Center activities. INSTAAR is a unique unit
of the University of Colorado.  It is solely dedicated to research and
completely separated, though complimentary, to the traditional academic
departments.  INSTAAR is an interdisciplinary Earth and Environmental Systems
Institute, and houses large and complex research programs.  Each individual
investigator has access to a depth and broad range of scientific expertise
that complements his/her research. The system Administrator is responsible for
the IT needs of the project.

## Indirect Costs

Indirect costs are charged according to our federally negotiated rate
agreement. The indirect cost rate for on-campus research is 53.5% of Modified
Total Direct Cost (MTDC), predetermined for the period 7/1/2015-6/30/2016;
54% MTDC, predetermined for the period 7/1/2016-6/30/2018; provisional
thereafter per HHS agreement dated 7/20/2015.

*Communication, Duplication & Postage*: includes such items as toll calls,
postage, fax charges, telephone lines, and photocopies that specifically
support this project. The University of Colorado maintains telecommunication
services that include the capability of tracking expenses to specific projects.
INSTAAR maintains photocopy services that include capability of tracking
expenses to specific projects.  The project includes co-investigators in other
states, and will be working with scientists from around the world. Activities
will include surface mail, fax, teleconferencing, and duplication of shared
material.

## Fringe Benefits

Fringe Benefits are calculated on requested salary per the University's
federally negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement, with the Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS). Applicable rates are 30.6% for academic
faculty, 37.7% for research personnel, and 13.7% for graduate research
assistants.

## Inflation

The University of Colorado's current budget planning parameters include an
annual inflation factor of 3% for salaries for investigators, post-doctoral
researchers, graduate research assistants, and hourly students. Tuition is
estimated to increase 3% per year, fringe benefits are estimated to increase
4.0% per year, and all other direct costs are estimated to increase 1.8% per
year.
