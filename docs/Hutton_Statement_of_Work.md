## Food-Energy-Water Systems in Mountainous Coastal Watersheds: Examining historical trajectories and the influence of human decisions

### Senior Personnel: Eric W. H. Hutton, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado

Dr. Hutton is a senior personnel on the proposed grant to the National Science
Foundation, *Food-Energy-Water Systems in Mountainous Coastal Watersheds:
Examining historical trajectories and the influence of human decisions*.
NSF requires that funding for collaborating institutions be executed through
a sub award under the Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water
Systems program.

The University of Colorado will participate in the model development and
coupling aspects of the proposed project.

Over the course of the 4-year project Eric Hutton will supervise the
coding work required to allow two (or more) models to dynamically exchange
information during their runs, functioning essentially as a single coupled
model. Tasks will include:

-   Work with model developers to ensure their models conform to the CSDMS
    standards and protocols that allow them to be incorporated into the CSDMS
    model-coupling framework (standards described here:
    http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI_Description).
-   Ensure model compatibility through data exchange items.
-   Aid in design of the integrative Food-Energy-Water modeling framework,
    particularly a model coupler algorithm that uses existing coupling tools
    from the CSDMS.
-   Evaluation of model code performance
-   Components and couplings are available through the CSDMS Component Modeling
    Tool.
-   Organization of model source code within open source repositories (source
    code will be housed on GitHub).

### Milestones in the project

*Year 1*: Attend kick-off meeting.
*Year 2*: Models will be wrapped with a Basic Modeling Interface so that they
can operate within the CSDMS framework.  All source code will be publicly
available on GitHub (or similar).
*Year 3*: Begin coupled simulations of the models. Simulations will be
able to be run within the CSDMS modeling framework.  
*Year 4*: Final coupling of simulations of the models.
