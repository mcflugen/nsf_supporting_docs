# Statement of Work – University of Colorado Sub-Award

## INFEWS/T1: Open source code and microservices software technology to develop next generation models for the food, energy, and water nexus

### Senior Personnel: Eric W. H. Hutton, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado

Dr Tucker and Dr Rogers are Co-Investigators, and Dr. Hutton is senior
personnel on the proposed grant to the National Science Foundation,
*INFEWS/T1: Open source code and microservices software
technology to develop next generation models for the food, energy,
and water nexus*.  NSF requires that funding for collaborating institutions
be executed through a sub award under the Innovations at the Nexus of Food,
Energy and Water Systems program.

The University of Colorado will participate in the model development and
coupling aspects of the proposed project.

Dr. Tucker is currently the Deputy Director of CSDMS, and will become
Executive Director in October 2017. He will coordinate CSDMS activities
and contributions at the University of Colorado with the rest of the
team at University of Arizona.

Dr. Rogers  identify salient components of the human and physical systems
necessary for model input and will communicate these with programmers
and model developers to ensure these are appropriately represented in
model code; she will also be responsible for evaluating and validating
integrated model outputs.

Over the course of the 4-year project Eric Hutton will supervise the
coding work required to allow models to run within the microservices
framework and that models conform and follow established CSDMS standards
and protocols.  Tasks will include:

-   Work with model developers to ensure their models conform to the CSDMS
    standards and protocols that allow them to be incorporated into the CSDMS
    model-coupling framework (standards described here:
    http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI_Description).
-   Ensure model compatibility through data exchange items.
-   Aid in design of the integrative Food-Energy-Water modeling framework,
-   Evaluation of model code performance

### Milestones in the project

*Year 1*: Attend kick-off meeting.  Work with ASU team to establish
protocols for microservice communication. Begin wrapping of the VIC
model to expose a BMI.
*Year 2*: Attend annual team meeting at ASU. Support necessary refactoring
of selected models so that they can be turned into microservices.  Ensure
compatibility with CSDMS framework.  
*Year 3*: Attend annual team meeting at ASU. Aid with coupled simulations
of the models and model development.  
*Year 4*: Attend final annual meeting. Aid with final coupling of
simulations of the models.
