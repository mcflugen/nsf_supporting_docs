# Statement of Work – University of Colorado Sub-Award

## Climate Change Adaptation in a Coupled Geomorphic-Economic Coastal System

### PI: Eric W. H. Hutton, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado

Dr. Hutton is an investigator on the proposed grant to the National Science
Foundation, Climate Change in a Coupled Geomorphic-Economic Coastal System. NSF
requires that funding for collaborating institutions be executed through a sub
award under the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems program.
The University of Colorado will participate in the model development and
coupling aspects of the proposed project.

Over the course of the 4-year project PI Eric Hutton will supervise the coding
work required to allow two (or more) models to dynamically exchange information
during their runs, functioning essentially as a single coupled model. Tasks
will include:

1. Work with model developers to ensure their models conform to the CSDMS
   standards and protocols that allow them to be incorporated into the CSDMS
   model-coupling framework (standards described here:
   http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI_Description).
2. Ensure model compatibility through data exchange items.
3. Individual models wrapped as components within the CSDMS modeling
   framework.
4. Components and couplings are available through the CSDMS Component
   Modeling Tool.
5. Organization of model source code within open source repositories
   (source code will be
   housed on GitHub).

### Milestones in the project

**Year 1**:
Geopmorphic model will be wrapped with a Basic Modeling
Interface so that they can operate within the CSDMS framework. All
source code will be publicly available on GitHub (or similar).

**Year 2**:
Coupled simulations of the geomorphic models. Simulations will be able
to be run within the CSDMS modeling framework.

**Year 3**:
Preliminary agent-based economic models will be wrapped with a Basic
Modeling Interface to couple with geomorphic models. Source code for the
economic models will be publicly available on GitHub (or similar).

**Year 4**:
Final coupling simulations of the geomorphic and agent-based economic models.
