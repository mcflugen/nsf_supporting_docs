# Data Management Plan

## Types of data 

The proposed work will not generate new data directly that would require
archiving, but will enable scientists to carry out complex modeling exercises
on a large array of Earth system data. The developed system will rely heavily
on a variety of data collected from different sources (government agencies,
data centers, research institutions, etc.). The University of Colorado team,
which is in charge of most of the data management aspect of the proposed work,
maintains a sizable archive of a wide range of geophysical, remote sensing and
climate data at the CSDMS computing facilities. The archive contains both the
data itself and detailed metadata from the original data providers or links to
documentation. Most of the data in the CSDMS archive are available publicly and
freely from the original data sources. In some cases, the original data
providers reserve data distribution rights, limiting the proposing team's
ability to pass the collected data to third parties.

Survey, interview, and observation data will be collected in order to evaluate
the system. The data will mainly be used to provide feedback to the developers
in how to better serve the user community and will be of little value for
reuse.

## Data and metadata standards

Our proposed system will utilize standard tools and rely heavily on data
standards gaining widespread adoption. A dominant part of the data used in the
modeling tools that our system will support are gridded fields of climate
variables and geophysical data. The most widely accepted format to store such
data is NetCDF (that is the primary choice for Earth System modelers). We will
follow the CF v1.x conventions (and UGRID 0.9 for unstructured meshes), both
for the internal NetCDF data structures, and as the means to embed metadata
into the individual data files. The managing of topological gridded networks
will require some extensions of the CF convention that we will submit to the CF
Metadata Trac maintained at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (CF
Conventions, 2014). For the naming of data variables, we will use the CSDMS
Standard Name conventions, which will soon provide a crosswalk to the CF
Standard Names. For the virtual globe component of this system, we will employ
KML (an OGC standard), CZML (an open format, based on JSON, thatâ€™s used in the
Cesium virtual globe environment) and GeoJSON (a standard quickly gaining in
popularity) for storing model metadata, as well as annotating and visualizing
model outputs.

We will rely heavily on accessing data through Web services, such as the CSDMS
Web Modeling Tools (compose and execute models, query model metadata, and
retrieve model output), OpenDAP/THREDDS or WaterOneFlow developed by
CUAHSI as part of their Hydrological Information System and the OpenGIS
Consortium Web Features and Web Coverage Services (WFS, WCS) enabling Visual
Globe interfaces. We adapt particular metadata and data standards to build a
system that not only complies with established
practices of collaborating institutions within the US, but also supports
interoperability with international partners participating in the construction
of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS).

## Policies for access and sharing and provisions for appropriate protection/privacy

The general data sharing policy of the participating institutions is driven by
openness. All products will be freely distributed under an Open Source license
(MIT).  None of the proposing institutions impose restrictions on accessing
or distributing data amongst each other or outside the project team - unless
imposed by a license agreement of the original data provider
To the extent that these license agreements permit, the
proposing team will make data from external sources and analysis results
publicly and accessible without cost.

We anticipate that the data handled in our system will not contain sensitive
information that would require the protection of privacy or national security.
We follow closely the policy changes of our data providers and revise our data
policies according to those changes.

Survey, interview, and observation data will be maintained in adherence
with the restrictions advised by the applicable Institutional Review Board(s).
Where possible these data will be made available, with documentation, to
members of the user community.


## Policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives

Source code and documentation developed by the project, will be will be
managed, publicly, on GitHub, with a open source license.  Other products, such
as technical reports, training products (presentation slides, handouts, sample
data, software guides, etc) will also be openly available on GitHub.  Any APIs
generated through the project will be well documented and freely and publicly
available to promote re-use and the generation of new products that make use
these APIs.

## Plans for Archiving and Preservation

The content and products of the FluidGlobe project will be periodically backed
up and archived using University of Colorado resources. Project source code,
data sets, and documents will be given DOIs allowing them to be catalogued
and preserved.
