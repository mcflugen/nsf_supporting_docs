# Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan

PI Peckham will supervise a postdoctoral researcher at the University of
Colorado at Boulder. The goal of this mentoring plan is to provide the best
possible environment for ensuring that the postdoctoral researchers develop the
skills and experience that would best position them on the path to a successful
subsequent career.

The postdoctoral researcher will participate in all project activities,
including meetings, teleconferences, and mailing list communications. In
addition, because a large fraction of this work requires close collaboration,
the other Co-PIs on this project will also take an active role in co-mentoring
the postdoctoral researcher. The following specific mentoring activities are
planned.

*  Establishing and implementing an Individual Development Plan (IDP) based the
   process described in [1].
*  Participation in writing reports and articles on research progress,
   encouraging the postdoctoral researcher to take the lead role when
   appropriate.
*  Participation in relevant seminars and activities at University of Colorado.
*  Participation in professional meetings, including CSDMS meetings,
   conferences, and workshops (travel funds are included in the budget) to
   present research progress and initiate or join collaborative activities.
*  Participation in local weekly research meetings and project-wide biweekly
   teleconferences at which all project members will present progress updates
   and plan future work.
*  Encouraging participation in the activities organized by the Postdoctoral
   Association of Colorado (http://www.colorado.edu/PAC/). PAC organizes
   workshops on various professional development themes, as well as more
   informal social events at the University of Colorado.
*  Opportunities to network with visiting scholars through formal or informal
   meetings.
*  One or two longer (e.g., a week or two) working visits at other PIs'
   institutions. 
*  Opportunities to participate in proposal preparation.

The effectiveness of this mentoring plan will be evaluated at least
semi-annually or more frequently as needed through discussions with the
postdoctoral fellows and by tracking their progress toward longer-term career
goals.
